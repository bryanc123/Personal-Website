                            a width greater than 1900px, content is centered, its width constrained by the max-width CSS property.

                        <p>
                            Recently, I completed another personal project, which was a quiz game.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I already have a quiz application listed among my personal projects, but this one is a bit
                            different.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The first quiz app is self-paced, more of a study tool than a game. It has no time limits, the user
                            can jump to different questions, and upon completion of the quiz, a review of correct and incorrect answers
                            is displayed.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            This new quiz app is a game. Questions have to be answered in order and within a time limit, and the user cannot make more than two
                            mistakes or the game is over. Two lifelines are provided to help the user select the correct answer.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The time limits are implemented using setInterval. After each question is answered, the timer is cleared and reset.
                            At one point in testing the app, I found that the timer was counting down too quickly. It seemed that the timer
                            was not being cleared even though the timer ID was being passed into clearInterval, so multiple instances of setInterval
                            were running. As it turns out, I had given the timer ID variable the same name as another variable that referred
                            to a DOM element. This simple and easiliy avaoidable mistake showed me that I had to be more organized.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            The logic and control flow of the program were tricky for me to grasp, and though the application
                            functions as I intended it to, the code that I wrote could still be much cleaner and more efficient.

                    <p class="post__date">Posted on 12/26/2021</p class="post__heading">
                    <div class="post__content">
                        <p>
                            My Angular application contains a particularly long form, so I recently decided to use
                            a form stepper provided by Angular Material to divide the form into parts and make the process of
                            filling it out smoother.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            I tried to follow one of the examples provided on the website for a responsive form stepper,
                            but errors came up stating that the classes I was trying to import were not available.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            After about an hour of tinkering with my code, I realized that I was not using the latest version
                            of Angular Material. In fact, running npm outdated showed that many project dependencies needed
                            to be updated.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Now the application has a form stepper that can switch between vertical and horizontal orientation
                            depending on screen size.
                        </p>
